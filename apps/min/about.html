    <p class="text-center">I play with words, data structures, algorithms, and file formats, emphasising on correct logic and readable code.</p>

    <p>I'm a software aficionado by night and a nameless writer by day (with four years of Physics and Philosophy at 
    the University of California, San Diego) interested in computers and publishing, respectively.</p>                               
    
    <p>Apart from founding a UI/UX agency, I work at Dentsu Aegis Network as a public relations executive; drafting, copy-checking, and revising formatted text meant for print or speech.</p>
    
    <p>Some of the brands I work with include: Microsoft, Dell EMC, Airtel, Shangri-La, Revlon, Durex</p>
    
    <p>I'd say my biggest influencers have been,</p>
    
    <p>Mother (Benevolence)<br>
    Father (Self-sufficiency)<br>    
    Noam Chomsky (Reason)<br>
    Aaron Swartz (Activism)<br>   
    Ben Shapiro (Rhetoric)<br>
    Milo Yiannopoulos (Tolerance)<br> 
    Ayn Rand (Objectivism)</p>
