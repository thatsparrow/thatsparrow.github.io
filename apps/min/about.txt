I play with words, data structures, algorithms, and file formats, emphasising on correct logic and readable code.

I'm a software aficionado by night and a nameless writer by day (with four years of Physics and Philosophy at 
the University of California, San Diego) interested in computers and publishing, respectively.                               

Apart from founding a UI/UX agency, I work at Dentsu Aegis Network as a public relations executive; drafting, copy-checking, and revising formatted text meant for print or speech.

Some of the brands I work with include: Microsoft, Dell EMC, Airtel, Shangri-La, Revlon, Durex

I'd say my biggest influencers have been,

Mother (Benevolence)
Father (Self-sufficiency)    
Noam Chomsky (Reason)
Aaron Swartz (Activism)   
Ben Shapiro (Rhetoric)
Milo Yiannopoulos (Tolerance) 
Ayn Rand (Objectivism)
